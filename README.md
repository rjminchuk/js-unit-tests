# js-unit-tests
A barebones, cross OS, approach to unit testing JS. 

[Blog Post](https://github.com/rjminchuk/Programming-Notes/blob/develop/md/jsTests.md) | Cross opperating system unit testing for JS

### todo
- replace wacky extend js with `underscorejs`
- refactor `MyUtility.js`. Instantiate the class in the test, then execute the function.
- replace instances of `function(d) { ...` with a clearer name. ie: `function(dependencies) { ...`
- remove implicit dependencides by injecting the date maker utility into test suite
- write up notes in blog post about what each file actually does. 
- shorten unit test scripts because... we get the idea already.
